### Database Configuration

The application can be configured to use a local or network database:

1. Open `src-tauri/config.toml`
2. Configure the database mode and paths:
   ```toml
   [database]
   # Database mode: "network" or "local"
   mode = "network"
   # Network database path
   network_path = "/path/to/network/share/DB"
   ```

3. For network functionality, ensure the network path is accessible and mounted on all machines.

### Default Admin User

The first time the application runs, it creates a default admin user:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

**Important**: Change this password immediately by logging in and accessing the user management section.
